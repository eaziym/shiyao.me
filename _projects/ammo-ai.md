## Overview

As a Software Engineer Intern at AMMO AI (Remote, London), I led full-stack development for experimental AI content features and marketing automation tools, shipping production features that increased user engagement and enabled data-driven iteration on AI models.

## The Journey

### 1. Fakers Labs - AI-Generated Podcasts

**Problem:**
- Experimental AI content lab needed innovative features
- User engagement plateau on existing content
- Needed to showcase AI capabilities creatively
- Complex multi-step content generation required

**Solution: Multi-Step LLM Pipeline**

**Orchestrated Pipeline Architecture:**
```
Existing Content Input
    ↓
Outline Generation (LLM)
    ↓
Script Writing (LLM)
    ↓
Style Transfer (LLM)
    ↓
Text-to-Speech (TTS)
    ↓
AI-Generated Podcast Output
```

**Implementation:**
- Led full-stack feature development
- Designed and implemented pipeline orchestration
- Integrated multiple LLM steps sequentially
- Built TTS integration for natural voice output
- Created user interface for podcast generation

**Technologies:** LLM APIs, Text-to-Speech, Next.js, Python, Pipeline Orchestration

**Results:**
- **30% increase** in user engagement
- Shipped to production on FakersAI
- Demonstrated innovative AI use case
- Smooth multi-step processing

### 2. Twitter AI Agent with Analytics Dashboard

**Problem:**
- Manual social media engagement time-consuming
- Needed to optimize response effectiveness
- No data on what prompts/content work best
- Difficult to measure engagement impact

**Solution: Context-Aware AI Agent + A/B Testing Platform**

**Twitter AI Agent:**
- Context-aware response generation
- Integrates with Twitter Dev API
- Sentiment-aware interactions
- Natural, humanized responses
- Supports 1,500 daily interactions

**Analytics Dashboard:**
- A/B testing framework for prompts
- Engagement measurement (sentiment, click-through)
- Real-time performance metrics
- Data-driven prompt iteration

**Technologies:** Twitter Dev API, Flask, Next.js, OpenAI API, Analytics Dashboard

**Workflow:**
```
Tweet Monitoring
    ↓
Context Analysis
    ↓
Response Generation (A/B variants)
    ↓
Deployment
    ↓
Engagement Tracking
    ↓
Sentiment Analysis
    ↓
Performance Dashboard
    ↓
Prompt Optimization
```

**Results:**
- **1,500 daily interactions** supported
- **Data-driven** prompt optimization
- **Measured engagement** metrics
- **Iterative improvement** of model performance

### 3. NeuroMesh Labs Frontend Development

**Problem:**
- Needed user-facing interfaces for AI Labs features
- Required seamless UI-backend integration
- Had to implement REST API connections

**Solution:**
Developed frontend for multiple Labs pages:
- **Text2Image**: AI-powered text to image generation interface
- **Image2Image**: Image transformation and editing tools
- **AI Agent**: Interactive AI agent interface

**Technologies:** Next.js, TypeScript, REST API, React

**Key Achievements:**
- Built 3+ production-ready Labs pages
- Implemented clean UI-backend integration
- Successfully integrated REST API calls
- Collaborated with CTO on UI/UX design
